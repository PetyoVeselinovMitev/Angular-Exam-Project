            Detective Napoleon Villaâ€™s latest case is spiraling out
            of control. Drawing on his
            skills,
            he battles to save former suspect Kyle Fasano from becoming the next victim.
            Yet no amount of training or experience could prepare him for the latest twist in the
            investigation.
            Kyle disappears in a loss that reverberates through his community, leaving his wife, Tamara, and
            their children under attack by forces beyond comprehension. Determined to protect her kids,
            Tamara
            must rely on her faith and her wits as she faces absolute evil.
